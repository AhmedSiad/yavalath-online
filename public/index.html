    <h1>Yavalath Online</h1>

    <p>Yavalath is a computer-generated board game created by a program called Ludi which was made by Cameron Browne in 2007.</p>
    <p>I could not find anywhere online to easily play this interesting board game online with friends, so I decided to make my own.</p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>The rules of the game are simple: two players, white and black, alternate turns placing their pieces down on the hexagonal board.
        If a player makes a line of 3 of their pieces in a row, they lose the game. However, if they make a line of 4 or more of their pieces in a row, they win the game.
